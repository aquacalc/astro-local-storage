import Test_NoLocalStorage from "../components/Test_NoLocalStorage.svelte";

The same import that works in the `.astro` file

  `import Test from "../components/Test.svelte";`


throws <mark>"Window is not defined"</mark> in this `.mdx` file (`/pages/no-go.mdx`).

<hr />

But an imported Svelte component without a dependency on the `window` object, `Test_NoLocalStorage.svelte`, works as expected:
<Test_NoLocalStorage client:only />

<hr />
